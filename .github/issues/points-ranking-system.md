# Points and Ranking System for Students

## Problem
There is currently no way to reward or rank students based on their participation and achievements in extracurricular activities.

## Proposed Solution
- Implement a points system: students earn points for participating in and winning events.
- Display each student's total points and ranking on their dashboard.
- Use points to determine "top students" or award titles.
- Show a leaderboard or points table for all students.

## Benefits
- Encourages participation and healthy competition.
- Makes achievements visible and trackable.
- Can be used for awards, certificates, or recognition programs.
